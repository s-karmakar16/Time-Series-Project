# Time-Series-Project

A project regarding the prediction of stock prices using R. Obtained data was from 1st January, 2018 to 31st August, 2021. Forecast was made on the next 20 days. These type of data, specially Stock market data is extremely hard to predict. Much accuracy cannot be achieved with only techniques of time series. A neural network based approach, namely LSTM can be used for much better results. But still in this project, the use of ARIMA and ARCH models have acheived quite satisfactory results.
